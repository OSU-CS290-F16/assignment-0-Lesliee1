		<p> The troubles i had with completing this assignment were with git and not knowing how to operate it from the command prompt. i didnt solve this issue yet - i just used the UI github has on its website to complete this assignment.
		<br><br> I learned that i should have already learned how to be proficcient with command prompt. - I already knew some very basic html.
		<br><br> I went to the insructors office hours for help to resolve my problems.
